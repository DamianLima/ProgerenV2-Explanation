# **Local Data Source Implementation**

This application uses **Room** to implement the local data source, providing a reliable and efficient database solution. The app features multiple screens where users can navigate lists (RecyclerView) and access editing or detail views. To handle data operations uniformly across these screens and entities, the following structure was designed:

---

## **FeatureRepository<T>: A Generic Repository Interface**
The **`FeatureRepository<T>`** interface serves as the main abstraction for managing data operations. It is designed to generically work with any data type `T` and is composed of two key repositories:

1. **Local Repository**: Handles all local data operations using Room.  
2. **Remote Repository**: Manages interactions with remote data sources like APIs or cloud services.

This approach ensures consistent and modular data flows, enabling seamless integration between local and remote data sources.

## **Local Repository**
The **local repository** is built generically to adapt to a wide variety of entities. Key aspects of its implementation include:

- **Base DAO (Data Access Object)**:  
  A generic `BaseDao` was created to standardize common database operations, such as:
  - Inserting items.  
  - Updating existing records.  
  - Deleting data.  
  - Querying information based on specific criteria.  

  Each entity-specific DAO inherits from this `BaseDao`, leveraging these common operations.

- **Layer Conversion**:  
  The local repository includes methods to transform database entities (data layer models) into domain models and vice versa. This ensures a clear separation between database structure and business logic.

---

## **Scalable and Reusable Design**
- **Generic Usage for Flexibility**:  
  By making the repository generic (`FeatureRepository<T>`), it can handle any type of data with minimal changes. This avoids code repetition and promotes reuse across different entities (e.g., `Illumination`, `ClimateEquipment`, etc.).

- **Modular Local Repository**:  
  The local repository interface is implemented specifically for each entity, such as `LightingLocalFeatureRepository` or `ClimateEquipmentLocalFeatureRepository`. This ensures customized behavior while maintaining a common structure.

- **Unified Data Access**:  
  The `FeatureRepository<T>` acts as a single source of truth by integrating local (Room) and remote repositories, providing a consistent data layer for the application.

This architecture not only simplifies data management but also ensures the application is maintainable and scalable as new features or entities are added. By decoupling responsibilities and leveraging generic programming principles, it aligns with modern best practices in Android development.
